Country B may invade the country and cause a nuclear war (bad to all), or being passive (timid) and let the other country develop the weapon without cause war (A is in an advantageous situation and B cannot act without becoming worse off).\n\n**2.** Probably yes if there is a competition between two standards. It may be a good model if we consider: both losing by having two standards. An aggressive company (A) can push its preferable standard and the other (B) being timid; this case has advantages of having only one standard. Nevertheless, the \"good\" solution would be having the two companies agreeing in a standard without any imposing their positions (both timid).\n\n**3.** No since they can work in cooperation and have the same shared goal. The energy efficiency of house A does not affect the payoff of house B.\n\n**4.** Probably no. But it can also be yes if they are competing for the same resource and decisions of A and B may affect each other."
